### 🚀 My Main Stack

I’m building my path as a **Fullstack JavaScript/TypeScript developer** with a handcrafted and creative mindset. Here’s the core tech I focus on:

#### 🔹 Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, SASS  
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- React (main), Vue.js (exploring)

#### 🔹 Backend
- Node.js with Express.js and NestJS  
- REST APIs with modular structure  
- Real-time systems using WebSocket *(in progress)*

#### 🔹 Database & Storage
- SQLite for simplicity and speed  
- Redis for real-time features and caching

#### 🔹 Tools & Workflow
- Git for version control  
- GitHub Pages for quick deployments  
- Puppeteer & Selenium for automation and testing

> My stack isn’t just a set of tools — it’s how I bring my ideas to life through simplicity, expression, and good structure.
