### 👨‍💻 About Me
 
* 🙃 Still starting out — not much to show yet, but building every day.
* Looking to join teams and communities.
* Hope to make friends I can code with.
  
> I'm just starting, but I'd rather make mistakes on my own path than succeed on yours.

* 🔭 Currently working on:
  - **Getti's TicTac** – An experimental game inspired by TicTacToe. *(private project)*
  - **Getti's JS Guide** – My own JavaScript course based on my experience. *(public project)* [Check the page](https://gettis-gh.github.io/gettis-js-guide/)
  - **Getti's Language DevKit** – The DevKit of my own experimental programming language. *(public project)* [Check the repo](https://github.com/gettis-gh/GettisPLDK)
  - **Stellar Panel** – An intuitive business managing tool. *(private project)*
  - **Stellar Chat** – An experimental chat exploring new ways to communicate. *(public project) (inactive at the moment)*

* What's Stellar? It's the more serious and professional part of my projects.
* 🌱 Currently learning: **WebSocket, Project Structure, CSS, Markdown, GitHub Pages**

> I see programming as an art.
